Website Analysis First of all, we run nmap and check which ports are open. As you can see, I ran a version scan with default scripts on the ports I found which were 80 (HTTP) and 3389 (RDP) to see if I could find anything interesting, but nothing turned up.

Next I checked the robots.txt file and found a possible password.

I also checked the disallowed entries and found a login page in /umbraco/, so we need to find our user since we already have the password!</description>

User Flag First, we start by enumerating the ports and services.
In the print below I have already set the ports to 22 and 8000 because I found out that they were open in a regular scan without any nmap flags.

I access the website and see that there is a login page. I try to create a user in the Sign-Up link to see what it looks like in there, but there is nothing interesting there.</description>

User Flag First, we use nmap to see which ports are open.
We notice that ports 22 and 80 are open. Since we hardly have something to explore on SSH, we start by accessing the website.
Here we collect a username and password (cmsmuser:devpass) and maybe another possible username (Hunter).
One of the nmap scripts brought us an existing robots.txt entry, so let&amp;rsquo;s check it out.
Here we find the installation path for cmsms, which is the manager that should be installed in this application, and we also collect the name of the db to be used: cmsmsdb.</description>
