<h2 id="website-analysis"><strong>Website Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>First of all, we run nmap and check which ports are open. As you can see, I ran a version scan with default scripts on the ports I found which were 80 (HTTP) and 3389 (RDP) to see if I could find anything interesting, but nothing turned up.</p>
<p><img src="/anthem/nmap.png" alt="nmap-anthem"></p>
<p><br>
Next I checked the robots.txt file and found a possible password.</p>
<p><img src="/anthem/robots.txt.png" alt="robots.txt"></p>
<p><br>
I also checked the disallowed entries and found a login page in /umbraco/, so we need to find our user since we already have the password!</p>
<p><img src="/anthem/login.png" alt="login"></p>
<p><br>
Navigating through the site, we can enumerate two users in the articles. In the first one we can get the Jane Doe user and also the domain of the website: anthem.com. We can also see that there is an email pattern, the first letters of the user name + @anthem.com.</p>
<p><img src="/anthem/domain.png" alt="domain"></p>
<p><br>
In the second article we can enumerate the user James Orchard Halliwell, but there is something more interesting in the text.</p>
<p>James said he made a poem to the admin. If we google this poem, we can find the administratorâ€™s name and consequently guess his email with the email pattern.</p>
<p><img src="/anthem/article.png" alt="article"></p>
<h2 id="spot-the-flags"><strong>Spot the Flags</strong></h2>
<p>It was possible to find 3 flags just by checking the source code in different pages.</p>
<p><img src="/anthem/flag1.png" alt="flag1"></p>
<p><img src="/anthem/flag2.png" alt="flag2"></p>
<p><img src="/anthem/flag4.png" alt="flag4"></p>
<p><br>
Navigating through the site you can find the other flag in the Jane Doe author page. I found it when I was enumerating users.</p>
<p><img src="/anthem/flag3.png" alt="flag3"></p>
<h2 id="final-stage"><strong>Final Stage</strong></h2>
<p>Using the email and password we found for the administrator, we can successfully login in the website. So, I also tried to login via RDP with the same credentials (without the domain) and was able to get the first access to the machine. The user&rsquo;s flag appears right on the desktop.</p>
<p><img src="/anthem/flag-user.png" alt="flag-user"></p>
<p><br>
After that, I was looking for the machine&rsquo;s administrator password and got stuck at that point. I took a look at the hint and enabled the option to view hidden items in Windows.</p>
<p>By doing this, I was able to find a txt that would probably have the administrator&rsquo;s password, but I couldn&rsquo;t open it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have permission to read the file, so I simply changed the permissions and was able to get the admin password.</p>
<p><img src="/anthem/change-permissions.png" alt="permissions"></p>
<p><br>
Now we just have to login in the machine via RDP and get the root flag that is also in the desktop.</p>
<p><img src="/anthem/root-flag.png" alt="root-flag"></p>
<p>See ya =).</p>
